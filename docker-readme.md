### Running on Kubernetes
Please refer to our [Kubernetes documentation](https://seatsurfing.app/docs/kubernetes/).

## Environment variables
Please check out the [documentation](https://seatsurfing.app/docs/config) for information on available environment variables and further guidance.

**Hint**: When running in an IPV6-only Docker/Podman environment with multiple network interfaces bound to the Frontend containers, setting the ```LISTEN_ADDR``` environment variable can be necessary as NextJS binds to only one network interface by default. Set it to ```::``` to bind to any address.
